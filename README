Instructions: two simple steps to run regSNPs
1. source("regSNPs.R")
2. regSNPs(...)

Specify the arguments '...' in the second step:
1. Arguments
   expt: customized name of the experiment.
   SNP: the name of the file which the INPUT SNP information are to be
   	read from. Default example file is included in the package.
   EndeavourResult: the name of the file which the transcription factor
   	rank information are to be read from. Default example file is 
	included in the package. This file should be generated by 
	software Endeavour: Aerts et al. Gene prioritization through 
	genomic data fusion. Nature Biotechnology.
   dir: directory that the input files (SNP and EndeavourResult) and the
   	output files are stored. Default is './'.
   GenomeDir: directory that the genome fasta files are stored. 
   	Default is 'hg18/'. 
   HapMapSNP: the name of the RData file where HapMap SNPs are stored. 
   	A default full verion of hapmap 127 based on hg18 is included.
   HapMapSNPsProSeq: the name of the RData file where 61bp sequences 
   	around HapMap promoter SNPs are stored. Default file is included
	in the package. 
   TFBS: the name of the RData file where TFBSs are stored. A default 
   	TRANSFAC version is included in the package.
   PromoterSNPsRatio: the ratio that pre-calculated for all HapMap 
   	promoter SNPs as for each TFBS. Default file is included in the
	package.
   RandomSNPsRatio: the rati0 that pre-calculated for randomized 10000
   	non-promoter SNPs as for each TFBS. Default file is included 
	in the package.
   rs: a logical indicating whether the INPUT SNP information includes
        the rs_id information. Default is FALSE.
   Permutation: a logical indicating whether to do permutation analysis
   	to calculate FDR. Default is FALSE, only ranks of the INPUT SNPs
	will be returned.
   RandomTimes: peromutation times, additional running time will be added.
   	Default is 1000.
   RanStep: a variable to accelarate the permutation test, should be less
   	than RandomTimes. Default is 200.
2. the INPUT files (SNP and EndeavourResult) should follow the examples
   provided in this package. e.g. the column headers.
3. note
   The default files included in the package are based on hg18. If any hg19
   INPUT filesare inlcuded, please transfer them to hg18, or re-generate all
   corresponding files based on methods described in our paper:
